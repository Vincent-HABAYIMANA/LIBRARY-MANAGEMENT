# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT
A Library Management System (LMS) automates library operations like book cataloging, user management, borrowing, and returning books. It tracks inventory, manages fines, and generates reports. LMS enhances efficiency, organizes resources, and improves user experience by allowing easy search, access, and management of library materials.
